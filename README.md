Dataset Access Using Kaggle API
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to access and download datasets from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
The goal was to work with large datasets efficiently without manually downloading files or using local storage.

This approach is especially useful when working in Google Colab, where storage is temporary.

🎯 Problem Statement

Large Kaggle datasets can be difficult to download manually

Google Drive storage can fill up quickly

Reproducible data access is important for machine learning workflows

💡 Solution

I used the Kaggle API to:

Authenticate securely using an API token

Download datasets directly into the Colab runtime

Extract and prepare data for analysis

This method avoids storage issues and supports reproducible workflows.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Kaggle API

Google Colab

Pandas

ZIP file handling

🔑 Workflow

Generate Kaggle API credentials from Kaggle account

Upload kaggle.json securely to Colab

Set file permissions for authentication

Download datasets using Kaggle commands

Extract and load data for analysis

📊 Use Case

Accessing large datasets for machine learning projects

Running experiments without saving data permanently

Faster and cleaner dataset setup in notebooks

👩‍💻 My Role

Configured Kaggle API authentication

Downloaded and managed datasets in Colab

Prepared data for further analysis and modeling

📈 Outcome

This project improved my understanding of data acquisition and dataset management using APIs and cloud-based notebooks. It also helped me work more efficiently with large datasets.

📌 Key Learning

Using the Kaggle API is a reliable and scalable way to access datasets and is a valuable skill for real-world data science workflows.


## 📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be deployed and used in real-world applications beyond notebooks.

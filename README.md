# 🌐 Machine Learning Model Deployment (Flask API)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on deploying a trained machine learning model using a **Flask REST API**.  
The goal was to make model predictions accessible through HTTP endpoints instead of notebooks.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Machine learning models are often built in notebooks but not usable in real applications.  
This project addresses the challenge of serving predictions in a simple and scalable way.

---

## 💡 Solution
I built a Flask-based REST API that:
- Loads a trained ML model
- Accepts input data
- Returns predictions in JSON format

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pickle (.pkl models)  
- GitHub  

---

## 🔌 API Features
- **Health check endpoint** to confirm the API is running
- **Prediction endpoint** to return model outputs
- Versioned structure for future model updates

---

## 👩‍💻 My Role
- Designed API structure  
- Loaded trained models  
- Implemented endpoints  
- Tested API responses  

---

## 📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be deployed and used in real-world applications beyond notebooks.
